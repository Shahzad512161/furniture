OAK & IRON FURNITURE - ADMIN SETUP GUIDE
========================================

Admin access is now controlled by a simple email prefix logic.

HOW TO CREATE AN ADMIN:
-----------------------
1. Go to the "Register" page.
2. Sign up using an email that starts with "admin" (e.g., admin@gmail.com, admin.test@oak.co.uk).
3. The system will automatically:
   - Assign 'role: admin' in the Firestore database.
   - Grant access to the Admin Dashboard in the UI.

ALTERNATIVE (MANUAL) METHOD:
----------------------------
If you already have an account and want to upgrade it:
1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Navigate to "Firestore Database" -> "Data" tab -> "users" collection.
3. Find your user document and change 'role' from 'customer' to 'admin'.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
------------------
- A "Dashboard" (Layout icon) will appear in the top Navbar.
- You will have full access to the /admin route to manage products and orders.
