OAK & IRON FURNITURE - ADMIN SETUP GUIDE
========================================

Since this is a production-ready app, there is no public "Register as Admin" 
button to prevent unauthorized access.

HOW TO CREATE AN ADMIN:
-----------------------
1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Go to the "Register" page and create a new account with your email.
3. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
4. Navigate to "Firestore Database" -> "Data" tab.
5. Look for the "users" collection.
6. Find the document corresponding to the email you just registered.
7. Click the "role" field and change its value from "customer" to "admin".
8. Refresh your website.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
------------------
- A "Dashboard" (Layout icon) will appear in the top Navbar next to your profile.
- You will have full access to the /admin route.
- You can now add, edit, and delete products and view customer orders.
